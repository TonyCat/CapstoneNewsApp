# Week 3
Need to have:
- [x] Switch following Source properties to use enum classes:
Category
Language
Country
- [x] Create a NewsService with a single method to get articles.
- [x] Reference NewsService from Activity and get the articles.
- [x] Your main activity layout should have a ScrollView at the top level.
- [x] Inflate a custom layout and loop through articles and set text (like title, author, etc) on the layout.
- [x] There should be an equivalent number of articles for each article element in your list.
Nice to have:
- [] Convert NewsService to an interface and create an InMemoryNewsServiceImpl class that implements NewsService to use in the Activity.  
- [x] Use a custom view called ArticleView that wraps the custom layout.
- [] Add nulls in your articles list and use the filter() extension function!
Note: Not enough time to complete Nice to have due to Holiday weekend



# Week 2
## To get a Good Job (Meets Expectations) grade: 
- [x] Data classes are created for Article and Source
- [x] Nullable types are used for certain properties which can be null such as author, source id. Other properties can be checked from News API documentation.
- [x] Hardcoded news data is saved in ArrayList
- [x] Layout for main activity is created
- [x] Loops are used for iterating the list and data is shown on the screen
- [x] Null checks are done using if/else statements
- [x] Code is divided into multiple functions instead of doing everything in onCreate(). At least one new function should be created.

## Nice to have (for an Above and Beyond grade)
- [x] Use default values with functions
- [x] Use maps to store hardcoded data instead of ArrayList


Week 2 ready for review
